* Lecture 1: Self-explainable Machine Learning Models
* Lecture 2: Post-hoc Explanation
* Lecture 3: Discrimination Testing and Remediation
* Lecture 4: Machine Learning Security
* Lecture 5: Machine Learning Model Debugging
* Lecture 6: Responsible Machine Learning Best Practices



## WIP Instructions and Rubric.
This is a pure technical writing assignment. Very little introduction, narrative, or conclusion text is necessary. You may make copious use of bullet points, charts, and tables. (But remember that all charts and tables should have descriptions!)

Your model card must include the following sections: Intended use, Training data, Evaluation data, Model details, Quantitative analysis, Ethical considerations. The focus of the model card should be your best performing remediated model. You should briey address your other models as \alternative approaches" in the Quantitative analysis section, and point to why your main model is a better choice.
